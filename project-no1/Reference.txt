  Basic & Adv Concepts (Project #1)
    components interaction 
    databinding

      1. Parent to Child Component Communication 
          using custom attribute @Input() 
      2. Child to Parent Comp Communication 
          using custom event binding @Output() 
      3. Any to Any Comp Communication

Project Structure
======
  #1 -- Building block wise project structure 
    src/
      app/
        components/
          home/
        directives/
        services/
        modules/
        guards/
        pipes/
        shared/

  #2 -- Feature-wise or page-wise project structure (Recommended)
    src/
      app/
        shared/
          components/
            header/
            footer/
            menu/
        concepts/
          components/
            employee/
            ceb/
            ...
            ...
            ...
          directives/
            colorizer/
        about/
        home/
        users/
          components/
            add-user/
            user-details/
            users...
          services/
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...

  #3 - Mixing both structure 
      src/
        app/
          home/
            components/
            directives/ 
            services/ 
          about/ 
            components/
            directives/ 
            services/ 
          shared/ 
            components/
              header/
