====
  Basic & Adv Concepts (Project #1)
    components interaction 
    databinding 
    routing 
    sharing data b/w diff components (Cross Component Communication)
      1. Parent to Child Component Communication 
          using custom attribute @Input() 
      2. Child to Parent Comp Communication 
          using custom event binding @Output() 
      3. Any to Any Comp Communication 
          3.1 using RxJS (Observables, Subject / Behaviour Subject, Subscription) 
          3.2 using NgRx (many do not have experience)

Project Structure
======
  #1 -- Building block wise project structure 
    src/
      app/
        components/
          home/
        directives/
        services/
        modules/
        guards/
        pipes/
        shared/

  #2 -- Feature-wise or page-wise project structure (Recommended)
    src/
        app/
          shared/
            components/
              header/
              footer/
              menu/
          concepts/
            components/
              employee/
              ceb/
              ...
              ...
              ...
            directives/
              colorizer/
          about/
          home/
          users/
            components/
              add-user/
              user-details/
              users...
            services/
          ...
          ...
          ...
          ...
          ...

  #3 - Mixing both structure 
      src/
        app/
          home/
            components/
            directives/ 
            services/ 
          about/ 
            components/
            directives/ 
            services/ 
          shared/ 
            components/
              header/
