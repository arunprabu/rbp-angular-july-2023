Building Blocks of Angular 
=====
  Components 
  Services  
  Guards
  Modules 
  Interceptor 

====
  Basic & Adv Concepts (Project #1)
    components interaction 
    databinding 
    routing 
    sharing data b/w diff components (Cross Component Communication)
      1. Parent to Child Component Communication 
          using custom attribute @Input() 
      2. Child to Parent Comp Communication 
          using custom event binding @Output() 
      3. Any to Any Comp Communication 
          3.1 using RxJS (Observables, Subject / Behaviour Subject, Subscription) 
          3.2 using NgRx (many do not have experience)

  Adv Concepts  
    RxJS 
    Unit Testing (many do not have experience) (project #1)
    HttpInterceptor (project #1 )
    Reusable component library a.k.a angular component library (many do not have experience) (project #2)
    CI / CD pipelines( project #1 or #2) 
    Angular 14 features 
    
  Third party tools
  ----
    NgRx (project #3)
    Angular Material (many do not have experience) (project #4)

    
Project Structure
======
  #1 -- Building block wise project structure 
    src/
      app/
        components/
          home/
        directives/
        services/
        modules/
        guards/
        pipes/
        shared/

  #2 -- Feature-wise or page-wise project structure (Recommended)
    src/
      app/
        shared/
          components/
            header/
            footer/
            menu/
        concepts/
          components/
            employee/
            ceb/
            ...
            ...
            ...
          directives/
            colorizer/
        about/
        home/
        users/
          components/
            add-user/
            user-details/
            users...
          services/
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...

  #3 - Mixing both structure 
      src/
        app/
          home/
            components/
            directives/ 
            services/ 
          about/ 
            components/
            directives/ 
            services/ 
          shared/ 
            components/
              header/
              footer/


Data Binding 
---
  * keeping the data in ts file and displayin it in HTML 
  1. Interpolation [DONE]
      TS => HTML 
      {{}}

  2. Property Binding [DONE]
      TS => HTML 
      []
      2.1 Class Binding [TODO]
      2.2 Style Binding [TODO]

  3. Event Binding [DONE]
      TS <== HTML 
      ()

  4. Two Way Binding 
      TS <==> HTML 
      [(ngModel)]

  5. Custom Property Binding 
  6. Custom Event Binding 
   

Cross Component Commn 
----
  1. Parent to Child Component Commn [DONE]
      using Custom Property Binding 
  2. Child to Parent Component Commn [DONE]
      using Custom Event Binding 
  3. Any to Any Component Commn 
      3.1 using RxJS (Observables, Subject / Behaviour Subject, Subscription) 
          [45 mins to 1 hour]
      3.2 using NgRx (many do not have experience) [1.5 - 2.5 hours]

====
Directives 
===
  Special instructions to the DOM
  1. Attribute Directive
      examples: routerLink, routerLinkActive, routerLinkActiveOptions, formGroup, formControlName

  2. Structural Directive 
      *ngIf 
      *ngFor 
      ngSwitch 

  3. Custom Attribute Directive 
      ng g d directive-name

  4. Custom structural Directive 
      ng g d directive-name
        Refer: https://github.com/arunprabu/employee-mgmt-ng-oct2022/blob/master/src/app/concepts/directives/demo-if.directive.ts

=========

User Management (CRUD App)
-----
  1. Create User (Reactive Form)
      http://localhost:4200/users/add
      ng g c users/components/add-user -s 

  2. List Users 
      http://localhost:4200/users
      ng g c users/components/users -s 

  3. Fetch User Details by Id 
      http://localhost:4200/users/1 
      ng g c users/components/user-details -s 

  4. Update User (Template Driven Form)
      http://localhost:4200/users/1 

  5. Delete User (TODO)
      http://localhost:4200/users/1

  Feature Module  (Creating Main Switching Box)
  Feature Routing Module (Create Navigational map)
    Nested Routing / Child Routing 
    URL Param 
    Query Param 
  
  Angular Forms 
    1. Reactive Forms [RECOMMENDED]
        * easy 
        * built with html + ts 
        * validate thru angular validators
        * adv 
          ---
            1. suitable for unit testing 
            2. suitable for complex form validation 

        * disadv 
        ----- 
          * big learning curve

        Steps: 
        ----
          1. have html form [done]
          2. have TS equivalent for the html form tag and form inputs 
          3. connect both html form and ts equivalents 


    2. Template Driven Forms 
        * easiest 
        * built with html 
        * validations to be done with directives
        * disadv
        ---
          1. not suitable for unit testing 
          2. not suitable for complex form validation 
  
  Services 
    Rest API call 
    Http Client 
    RxJS 
      Observables, Subscription 


    


Class Commn 
--
  1. Thru Object creation (instantiation)
  2. thru inheritance 
  3. thru dep injection 


@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
class RepairService {
  doRepair(){

  }
}

class Car  {
  constructor( private repairService: RepairService ){
    this.repairService.doRepair();
  }
}

class Bike {
  constructor( private repairService: RepairService ){
    this.repairService.doRepair();
  }

}

class Bus {
  constructor( private repairService: RepairService ){
    this.repairService.doRepair();
  }
